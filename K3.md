#### Alpha

an image with alpha

![](K3/apple.png)

The background of this apple is not white but transparent so that we can put this apple image on top of another image.

##### Alpha analyse in a Max Patch

![](K3/18.png)

As you can see, the apple is filled with value 255 in the alpha channel. This means this part of the image is completely **opaque** but the rest is totally transparent.

##### Image without alpha

This dog image's alpha plane is all white. This means this image is completely opaque and has no transparent parts.

##### Alpha Blending

- jit.alphablend ... allows use to blend two images using alpha channel

#### Assignment 4

In the patch above swap the image of dog and apple, and check how it processes the two images.
